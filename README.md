### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am Aman Harwara, a front-end web developer & designer, a musician and an open-source enthusiast. I've been programming since my childhood and have been working on open-source software for 3 years now.

I'm familiar with tech like **React** and **Svelte** for front-end development, **Electron** for cross-platform desktop apps, **Sass** for CSS pre-processing, **Figma** for web design and **Git** for version control.

#### The main projects I'm working on currently are:
- [Altus](https://github.com/amanharwara/altus) â€“ Desktop client for WhatsApp Web that adds many extra features.
- [Chartr](https://github.com/amanharwara/chartr) â€“ A web-app to create custom music charts and album collages.
